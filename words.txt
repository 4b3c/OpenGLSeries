The dark sky shakes the earth, and the tsunami of cold air engulfs me. It's no use running, my ability to balance is like that of a bowling pin on it's head. My face gets patted with giant raindrops and such force that they no longer feel liquid. My clothes are drenched, I feel like a golden retriever emerging from a pool. As a twig flies by me a turn and more water slaps me in the face. Home is so far, safe is so far. All I can do is give up and as I do, I realize the beauty of the danger. I realize the beauty of my insignificance. I realize how weak and useless I am and that I have no control over what happens to me. If the wind wanted to throw me against rocks and suck the breath from my lungs, it could. The fury of mother nature was beautiful, but only if the abyss stares at you and you stare back at it.
